# SQ4CDBirdyEggRestore

## version 0.5.1

Versions 0.3 and 0.4 had crashes - Please update to 0.5.1

I've confirmed both easter eggs are now fulling working in SCUMMVM 2.2.0 (works with text, voice, or both) and DOSBox 0.74-3 (text or speech). This 'should' be the final version of the patches, but please report any issues!

 Restores both software store easter eggs in the CD version of SQ4. Also fixes the Floppy version lockup when both eggs are executed at the same time. 

## INSTALLATION

Copy the 397.hep, 397.scr and 397.v56 files into your SQIV game folder.
